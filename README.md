Food Truck Explorer
==========

A web app that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location. 

Just input your address and explore the foodtrucks around you. Just note that the food truck may be at a different location. The location shown is the closest it could be to you since the Database does not provide timing information. A link to the food truck's schedule is provided if you click on the truck icon!

This app can be found @ http://foodtruckexplorer.herokuapp.com/
